OmegaX’s AI Doctors form the backbone of our proactive healthcare model. This section shows how they fuse clinical insights with advanced AI to deliver real-time, context-aware support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key Idea: An AI Doctor doesn’t just respond to user questions—it continuously monitors data, identifies trends, and prompts action before issues escalate.

## 1. Concept

**OmegaX “AI Doctors” are more than chatbots.**

They:

- **Ingest** fresh data from the [Data Feed](../data-feed) (vitals, lab results, symptom logs).
- **Analyze** that data in light of established medical guidelines.
- **Engage** with users via voice calls or text-based chat.
- **Alert** them (and potentially real clinicians) when crucial symptoms or thresholds appear.

## 2. Core Features

{{< tabs items="Symptom Triage,Daily Health Plans,Contextual Guidance" >}}

  {{< tab >}}
**User Logs Symptom**

- Example: **"Chest discomfort," "Headache," etc.**

**AI Cross-Checks**

- Compares user’s complaint with **personal history** (e.g., hypertension, family history).

**Advice & Severity**

- Suggests **self-care** or **escalation to a physician** if needed.

  {{< tab >}}
**Chronic Condition Management**

- If you have **diabetes**, the AI might adjust your **diet plan** after detecting a high glucose reading.

**Preventive Tasks**

- Reminds you of **routine checkups or screenings** (e.g., annual physicals).

  {{< tab >}}
**Location-Based Reminders**

- If you're at a **high-altitude location** and have a **heart condition**, the AI might urge extra caution.

**Time-Based Nudges**

- Tracks **medication schedules** or provides **circadian rhythm-based advice** (e.g., sleep/wake cycles).

## 3. Workflow

{{% steps %}}

### Step 1: Data Integration

The **AI Doctor** monitors new entries in the user’s timeline—such as a wearable detecting an **abnormal heart rate** or a user logging symptoms like dizziness.

### Step 2: Medical Reasoning

An **LLM-based engine** or specialized model processes these inputs. It references **best practices** (e.g., arrhythmia detection guidelines) and **user context** (past vitals, comorbidities).

### Step 3: Recommendation or Alert

If the AI detects a concerning trend, it may:

- **Update the user’s daily plan** (e.g., advise rest, hydration).
- **Trigger a voice call** for urgent check-in.

### Step 4: User Interaction

Via **chat or voice call**, the AI explains the rationale behind its advice. If the user prefers clinician input, the AI may:

- **Schedule a telehealth appointment**.
- **Provide a clinic referral**.

## 4. Interaction Modes: Talk, Type, or Tap

> An AI that doesn’t engage isn’t intelligence—it’s just data.

  {{< card link="/" title="Interaction mode: Chat" image="image.webp" subtitle="Key Benefits: Supports async Q&A, easy for daily use. Best for quick check-ins, clarifications." >}}
  {{< card link="/" title="Interaction mode: AI-Generated UI (Structured Outputs)" image="image.webp" subtitle="Key Benefits: Presents structured options instead of open chat. Best for forms, health tracking, and decision flows." >}}

## 5. Escalation Logic

| Trigger | Action | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Severe Symptom** | Immediate Voice Call | “Extreme chest pain” → AI calls user, suggests 911 if urgent. |
| **Mild to Moderate** | Chat Prompt / Self-Care Recommendation | “Mild headache” → offers hydration tips, logs follow-up check. |
| **Routine Follow-Up** | Notification or Scheduled Check-In | “Weekly blood pressure check” → user gets gentle daily nudges. |
