The **Data Feed** is OmegaX’s central mechanism for **collecting** and **standardizing** every piece of health-related information. This includes **wearable metrics**, **medical records**, **lab results**, **symptom journals**, and more. By consolidating all of these data streams into a **single, continuous feed**, we can support real-time AI insights and proactive user engagement.

## What is the Data Feed?

Think of the Data Feed as a **living timeline** of each user’s health. Whenever a new piece of information arrives—be it a blood pressure reading, a PDF lab report, or a symptom entry—the Data Feed **integrates** that update into a coherent, chronological record.

- **Holistic Understanding**: Fragmented data makes it impossible to see health trends in context (e.g., stress levels vs. heart rate changes).
- **Real-Time AI**: AI can only act proactively if it’s aware of **all** relevant signals the moment they come in.
- **Medical Continuity**: Providers who access a user’s OmegaX data get a single source of truth, rather than scattered bits from different apps or wearables.

## Data Sources

OmegaX integrates **multiple data streams** into the feed:

{{< tabs items="Fitness,Clinical,User,Environmental" >}}

  {{< tab >}}
OmegaX connects to **Apple HealthKit, Google Fit, and smartwatches** to pull in real-time health data.

- Tracks **steps, active minutes, and workouts** to monitor movement levels.
- **Heart rate monitoring** includes resting heart rate, variability, and stress indicators.
- **Sleep tracking** helps analyze sleep patterns and detect irregularities.

Data updates **continuously or in short intervals**, depending on the device. This helps detect **trends in fitness, recovery, and overall health** without users having to log anything manually.

Medical records are pulled from **electronic health systems (EHRs), lab results, and imaging reports** when available.

- **Lab tests** (bloodwork, cholesterol, glucose levels)
- **Medical imaging** (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans)
- **Doctor updates** for chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension

Most hospitals use **FHIR or HL7 formats**, but PDFs are also supported if users upload their reports. Unlike fitness data, this information updates **only when a healthcare provider submits new records**—so it’s less frequent but highly valuable.

Not everything comes from devices. Users can manually log symptoms, mood, medications, or anything else they want to track.

- **Symptom journals** help track patterns (e.g., headaches, fatigue).
- **Mental health check-ins** allow mood tracking over time.
- **Medication adherence logs** help ensure users stay on track with prescriptions.

Some inputs can be added via **voice prompts** (e.g., “Log chest pain level 3 at 2 PM”), making tracking easier without typing. This data is stored alongside wearable and medical data for a complete picture.

Health isn’t just about the body—it’s also about surroundings. OmegaX can factor in **location-based data** to give smarter recommendations.

- **GPS tracking** detects activity changes (e.g., if someone’s altitude suddenly increases, it might suggest hydration).
- **Weather and pollution data** help connect symptoms like allergies or breathing issues to external factors.
- **Circadian rhythm tracking** aligns sleep advice with local time zones.

This kind of contextual data makes AI-powered recommendations **more relevant to real-world conditions** instead of just relying on raw health numbers.

## Data Standardization

| **Process** | **Purpose** | **Example** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Unit Normalization** | Standardizes vitals to avoid inconsistencies across devices. | Converts BP from **kPa to mmHg**, glucose from **mmol/L to mg/dL**. |
| **Metadata Augmentation** | Adds timestamps, time zones, and device IDs for better tracking. | Tags a heart rate reading as **“post-exercise”**, ensuring AI interprets context correctly. |
| **Quality Checks** | Detects outliers and eliminates duplicates. | Flags a **500 bpm heart rate** as invalid or removes overlapping entries. |

### **Example Data Flow**

{{% steps %}}

### Step 1: Data Capture

A **smartwatch logs a 90 bpm heart rate at 09:00** and syncs it to OmegaX.

### Step 2: Unit Normalization

OmegaX checks the measurement units (**beats per minute is standard, so no conversion needed**).

### Step 3: Metadata Augmentation

- The reading is tagged as **“post-breakfast walk”**.
- A **timestamp and time zone** are added.
- The **device ID** is linked for traceability.

### Step 4: Quality Checks

- OmegaX **flags implausible readings** (e.g., **500 bpm heart rate**).
- If multiple devices report the same data, **duplicates are merged or discarded**.

### Step 5: Data Integration

The cleaned and standardized entry is **merged into the Data Feed** for AI analysis.

## Timeline & Visualization

The Data Feed is organized as a **chronological sequence** of entries:

> Heart rate: 90 bpm (9:00 AM) → Blood Pressure: 130/80 (9:30 AM) → Symptom: Mild headache (10:00 AM)

Each event is accompanied by metadata (source, category) and can be filtered or grouped in the frontend. The **AI Doctor** regularly scans these entries to detect unusual patterns or significant changes.

{{< callout type="note" >}}
  **Clinical Reliability:** For official medical decisions, the **AI Doctor** cross-references multiple data points. A single outlier reading may trigger a **recheck**, but it will not generate an immediate medical alert unless it is **drastically abnormal**.

## Real-Time Updates

Once a new data point is added:

### Step 1: Immediate Store

A new data point is captured and added to the **Data Feed**.

### Step 2: AI Processing

The **Omega AI Doctor** evaluates the update in real-time and determines if any action is needed.

### Step 3: User Notification

If flagged as important, the system triggers a **push notification, voice call, or chat prompt** to inform the user.

### Step 4: Continuous Learning

The AI refines future responses based on data patterns, improving accuracy.

This continuous cycle ensures that **no data**—however small—goes unnoticed. By layering all input sources into one feed, OmegaX creates a dynamic, ever-evolving **health portrait** that positions users (and their providers) to anticipate and prevent problems, not just react to them.

{{% details title="Future Expansions" closed="true" %}}

- **Integration with Genetic Data**: Enables long-term risk analysis (e.g., predisposition to cardiovascular conditions).
- **Pharmacy & Prescription Tracking**: Logs prescription refills directly into the feed for medication compliance.
- **ML-Driven Cleansing**: Automated anomaly detection for spurious readings, especially from consumer devices.

In essence, the Data Feed is the **lifeblood** of OmegaX—pulling together every relevant data point into a unified timeline that both users and the AI Doctor can act on, shifting healthcare toward a **continuous, preventive** model of well-being.
