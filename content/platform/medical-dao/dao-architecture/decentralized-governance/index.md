OmegaX Medical DAO operates through a decentralized governance model that enables token holders to directly influence insurance policies, AI claim processing methods, risk management strategies, and operational decisions.

Governance rights are granted to users who stake $OmegaX tokens on their selected blockchain—either Binance Smart Chain (BSC) or Solana. Voting power is directly proportional to the number of tokens staked on that particular chain.

**Each blockchain (BSC and Solana) maintains its own independent DAO structure**, effectively operating as separate insurance entities—similar to two distinct insurance companies (e.g., Generali and Allianz). Decisions, proposals, risk management, and financial parameters are fully independent and customized per blockchain.

## Areas Governed by Token Holders

Token holders govern and vote on key aspects, including:

- **Insurance Premiums and Coverage Terms**
    - Adjusting premium rates, deductible levels, and the scope of insurance coverage.
- **AI Claim Processing**
    - Choosing which AI models will handle medical claim validation, fraud detection, and risk analysis.
    - Setting claim-processing thresholds and criteria.
- **Risk Pool Management**
    - Defining the liquidity requirements, collateral levels, and rewards structure within decentralized insurance pools.
- **Blockchain Integration and Bridging**
    - Expanding DAO operations to additional blockchains, managing cross-chain liquidity, and deciding interoperability protocols.
- **DAO Treasury Allocation**
    - Allocating funds from DAO treasuries for ecosystem growth, development efforts, security audits, and marketing.

## Governance Process

The decentralized governance workflow is structured as follows:

### 1. Proposal Creation

Any token holder meeting the minimum token staking requirement can submit governance proposals detailing policy or operational changes.

### 2. Proposal Review and Voting Period

After initial submission, proposals enter a predefined review and voting period, visible to all eligible participants.

### 3. Token-Based Voting

Token holders cast votes proportional to their staked tokens. Voting occurs separately and independently on each blockchain (BSC or Solana).

### 4. Proposal Outcome

Proposals pass or fail based on majority voting outcomes. Critical proposals may require a higher approval threshold.

### 5. Automated Execution

Approved proposals automatically trigger on-chain smart contract execution, ensuring immediate and transparent implementation.

Each DAO (BSC and Solana) independently governs its policies and strategies, offering tailored solutions that best fit the specific ecosystem and community requirements.
