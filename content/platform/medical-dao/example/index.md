This section provides a detailed, step-by-step practical integration example, illustrating exactly how OmegaX Health’s decentralized medical DAO, multi-chain data storage, AI-driven insurance claims processing, and tokenomics all integrate seamlessly in real-world usage scenarios.

## Example Scenario: User Submitting a Decentralized Health Insurance Claim

### Scenario Overview

In this practical example, we explore a complete user journey involving:

- Health data entry
- AI-driven decision making
- Data storage (IPFS & blockchain)
- Insurance claim submission
- AI-powered claim verification
- Automated decentralized payout from insurance pools

## Step-by-Step Integration Example

### Step 1: Health Data Entry & Storage

**Scenario:**

- User records a new symptom (e.g., severe headache), updates their health profile, and uploads medical documentation (doctor’s report, MRI scans).

**Technical Steps:**

1. Data structured in JSON format (TaskData, DataEntry schemas).
2. JSON data hashed (SHA-256) to ensure data integrity.
3. Data uploaded to IPFS, receiving a Content Identifier (CID).
4. CID and hash stored as a blockchain transaction on the user's selected blockchain (Solana or BSC).

**Sample JSON Data:**

```json
{
  "entryType": "SYMPTOM",
  "symptomDetails": {
    "description": "Severe headache and dizziness",
    "urgency": "HIGH",
    "location": ["HEAD_FOREHEAD", "HEAD_TEMPLES"],
    "loggedTimestamp": "2025-04-01T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "documents": [
    {
      "type": "MEDICAL_REPORT",
      "ipfsCid": "<IPFS_CID_for_report.pdf>"
    },
    {
      "type": "MRI_SCAN",
      "ipfsCid": "<IPFS_CID_for_scan.jpg>"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Blockchain Transaction Example (Solana):**

```js
OMGX:4e3fa9:<IPFS_CID>:1711965600:HEALTH_PROFILE_UPDATE
```

### Step 2: AI-Driven Medical Decision

**Scenario:**

- OmegaX’s AI agent analyzes new symptoms and recommends immediate medical attention, updating the user’s health plan tasks accordingly.

**Technical Steps:**

1. AI generates a recommendation task based on analysis.
2. Task recorded and stored with a new blockchain transaction (same hashing and storage method).

**AI Decision JSON Example:**

```json
{
  "taskId": "task_123",
  "type": "REMINDER",
  "title": "Urgent Doctor Consultation Recommended",
  "description": "Based on your symptoms, immediate medical consultation is advised.",
  "urgency": "CRITICAL",
  "scheduledTimestamp": "2025-04-01T10:05:00Z",
  "generatedBy": "AI"
}
```

Blockchain transaction stored similarly to previous step.

### Step 3: Insurance Claim Submission

**Scenario:**

- User visits a medical provider, incurs costs, and subsequently submits a decentralized insurance claim via the OmegaX app.

**Claim Submission Technical Flow:**

1. User submits claim including transaction details, medical reports (already IPFS stored), symptom logs, and doctor's invoice details.
2. Claim structured as JSON, hashed, and stored on IPFS & selected blockchain.

**Sample Claim JSON:**

```json
{
  "claimId": "claim_789",
  "userId": "user_123",
  "treatmentDetails": {
    "diagnosis": "Migraine",
    "totalCost": 500.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "providerDetails": "Central Hospital, Zagreb"
  },
  "linkedData": [
    "<Hash_of_initial_symptom_entry>",
    "<Hash_of_AI_decision_recommendation>",
    "<IPFS_CID_invoice_document>"
  ],
  "submittedTimestamp": "2025-04-02T14:00:00Z"
}
```

Blockchain transaction example (BSC):

```json
OMGX:9af23b:<IPFS_CID>:1712066400:INSURANCE_CLAIM
```

### Step 4: AI-Powered Claim Verification

**Scenario:**

- AI automatically verifies the claim by cross-checking blockchain and IPFS-stored hashes and data validity.

**Claim Verification Flow:**

1. AI fetches hashes and IPFS documents.
2. Confirms integrity by matching recomputed hashes.
3. Evaluates eligibility based on insurance terms stored in the decentralized DAO policies.
4. AI decision logged on-chain.

**Sample API Call for Verification:**

```json
POST /api/claim/verify
{
  "claimId": "claim_789",
  "chain": "BSC",
  "linkedHashes": [
    "<Hash_of_initial_symptom_entry>",
    "<Hash_of_AI_decision_recommendation>"
  ]
}
```

**AI Response Example:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "claimId": "claim_789",
  "verified": true,
  "aiDecision": "APPROVED",
  "coverageAmount": 450.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "blockchainSignature": "<tx_hash>",
  "detailsLink": "<blockchain_explorer_link>"
}
```

### Step 5: Automated Decentralized Payout

**Scenario:**

- AI-approved claims automatically trigger smart contracts to release payout instantly from decentralized insurance pools.

**Technical Flow:**

1. Smart contract on-chain processes AI approval.
2. Instant transfer executed to user’s wallet address from insurance pool.

**Smart Contract Payout (Solidity, BSC):**

```js
function executeClaimPayout(address claimant, uint256 amount) external onlyAuthorized {
    require(poolBalance >= amount, "Insufficient pool balance");
    omegaXToken.transfer(claimant, amount);
    emit ClaimPaid(claimant, amount, block.timestamp);
}
```

## Cross-Chain Integration Examples

{{< tabs items="BSC (Solidity),Solana (Rust)" >}}

  {{< tab >}}
```js
function stakeOmegaX(uint256 amount) external {
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake zero");
    omegaXToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    stakedBalances[msg.sender] += amount;
    emit Staked(msg.sender, amount, block.timestamp);
}
```
  {{< /tab >}}

  {{< tab >}}
```rust
let memo = format!("OMGX:{}:{}:{}:{}", derived_hash_id, cid, timestamp, "INSURANCE_CLAIM");
invoke_signed(
    &system_instruction::transfer(&payer_pubkey, &destination_pubkey, lamports),
    &[payer_account.clone(), destination_account.clone(), system_program.clone()],
    &[&[&memo.as_bytes()]],
)?;
```
  {{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

## API Integrations & Third-Party Usage

- OmegaX provides open APIs enabling hospitals, clinics, or independent apps to integrate seamlessly, submit claims, store data, or verify claims independently through permissionless endpoints:
    - `POST /storage`
    - `GET /verify`
    - `POST /claim/verify`

## Benefits of This Practical Integration

- **Full transparency:** All steps publicly verifiable on-chain.
- **Instant & automated payouts:** AI-driven verification and smart contracts eliminate manual delays.
- **Cross-chain flexibility:** Users freely select blockchain ecosystems.
- **Permissionless integration:** External health services and providers easily integrate into OmegaX ecosystem.
