OmegaX Health operates two fully independent decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), each governed separately through distinct $OmegaX tokens on Solana and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Each DAO functions autonomously, managing its own token, governance, decentralized insurance pools, and staking incentives—effectively operating as two separate decentralized insurance entities, similar to distinct decentralized insurance companies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The two tokens and DAOs—Solana and BSC—are entirely separate, distinct, and non-interoperable ecosystems. Essentially two different independent decentralized insurance companies which can create game theory competition and market dynamics.
>
> The stored hashed data is interoperable, and the OmegaX Agent is interoperable with both DAOs/Decentralized Insurances.
>
> As we validate this model, there might be more DAOs launched by others in the future following our steps in building a decentralized AI powered healthcare system.

## Token Specifications & Distribution

Each blockchain has its unique $OmegaX token with fixed total supply and distinct allocations:

### **Solana ($OmegaX token - Already Launched via Pump.fun)**

- **Total Supply:** Fixed at **1,000,000,000 tokens** (fully minted, no inflation).

**Distribution (Solana):**

- **Free market**
- **OmegaX.sol Treasury (20% total):**
    - Operational Costs & Team: **5%**
    - DAO Governance & Locked Funds: **15%**

### Binance Smart Chain ($OmegaX token - Launching via Four.meme)

- **Total Supply:** Fixed at **1,000,000,000 tokens** (fully minted, no inflation).

**Distribution (BSC):**

- *Free market*
- **OmegaX.sol Treasury (20% total):**
    - Operational Costs & Team: **5%**
    - DAO Governance & Locked Funds: **15%**

## Independent DAO Structures (Solana & BSC)

Each DAO ecosystem operates completely autonomously:

- **Solana DAO:** Governed exclusively by holders of Solana’s $OmegaX token. Capitalizes on Solana’s rapid transactions and low fees.
- **BSC DAO:** Governed exclusively by holders of BSC’s $OmegaX token. Benefits from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and broader blockchain integrations.

Each DAO independently manages:

- Insurance coverage terms and premium rates
- AI claim verification processes
- Risk pool management and liquidity provisioning
- Governance proposals, voting procedures, and DAO policy decisions

## Token Utility & Ecosystem Roles

Each DAO’s $OmegaX tokens independently serve key ecosystem functions:

### 1. Governance & Voting Power

- Token holders stake $OmegaX tokens to participate actively in governance decisions within their blockchain-specific DAO, directly influencing insurance terms, AI claim-processing algorithms, risk management, and ecosystem policies.

### 2. Insurance Pool Staking & Rewards

- Users and institutions stake tokens in decentralized risk pools, providing liquidity for immediate claim payouts and earning proportional rewards directly from collected insurance premiums.

### 3. Insurance Claim Collateral

- Tokens staked into risk pools serve as liquidity, enabling immediate decentralized payouts for AI-verified insurance claims, removing delays typical in traditional insurance structures.

### 4. Premium Platform Features & Access

- Tokens grant access to enhanced services within OmegaX Health’s platform, such as advanced health management features, premium data storage, and exclusive AI-driven healthcare interactions.

## Token Flow & User Journey Example

A simplified illustration of how tokens flow within each DAO ecosystem:

- **Token Acquisition:** Users purchase $OmegaX tokens via decentralized or centralized exchanges (DEX/CEX).
- **Staking into Risk Pools:** Tokens are staked in decentralized insurance pools, generating yield from continuously collected insurance premiums.
- **Governance Engagement:** Users participate in DAO governance, voting on policies, insurance terms, AI claim processing models, and risk management parameters.
- **Claims & Payouts:** Insurance claims verified by AI are immediately and automatically settled through instant payouts directly from risk pools to insured users’ wallets.
- **Premium Access:** Users utilize tokens to access advanced healthcare services and premium AI-based features.

## Decentralized Insurance & Revenue Model

- **No Separate Operational Treasury:**
Each DAO exclusively maintains funds within decentralized insurance risk pools.
- **Premium Revenue Flow:**
Insurance premiums collected directly flow into decentralized risk pools, exclusively reserved for insurance claim payouts and proportional rewards to pool stakers. Apart from the initial predefined operational allocation (Solana: 5%, BSC: 5%), no funds are separately reserved for DAO-managed operations or marketing.

## Technical Example: Smart Contract for Token Staking (BSC Solidity)

```js
contract OmegaXInsuranceStaking {
    IERC20 public omegaXToken;
    mapping(address => uint256) public stakedBalances;

    constructor(address tokenAddress) {
        omegaXToken = IERC20(tokenAddress);
    }

    function stakeTokens(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        omegaXToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        stakedBalances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdrawTokens(uint256 amount) external {
        require(stakedBalances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient staked amount");
        stakedBalances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        omegaXToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion & Strategic Outlook

OmegaX Health’s dual-blockchain tokenomics model provides clear, stable, and distinct decentralized healthcare insurance solutions on both Solana and BSC. Each blockchain’s DAO independently optimizes governance, AI-driven claim verification, and risk management, tailored to leverage ecosystem-specific strengths, ensuring transparency, effectiveness, and decentralized healthcare innovation at scale.
